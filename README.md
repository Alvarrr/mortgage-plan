# mortgage-plan
A java application that calculates how much a customer needs to pay each month in order to pay off their mortgage in X years.
Makes use of Gradle for building the application.

Run application via command line by building it and using the "gradlew run" command. This will output all of the calculations.
You can also simply run the main class with Gradle through your preferred IDE.

The JUnit testing class (src/test/java/MortgageTest) can in a similar vein be run via command line with the "gradlew test" command.
The testing results/output can be viewed at build/reports/tests/test/index.html.
