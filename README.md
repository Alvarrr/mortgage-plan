# mortgage-plan
A java application that calculates how much a customer needs to pay each month in order to pay off their mortgage in X years.
Makes use of Gradle for building the application.

Run application via command line by building it, and using the "gradlew run" command. This will output all of the calculations.

The JUnit testing class (src/test/MortgageTest) can in a similar vein be run via command line with the "gradlew clean test --info" command.
